This guide is broken into section areas with index pages and links to security-related docs.

All of these links have betten vetted and approved by Molly Crowther.

## Questions

1. Do we want to provide links to docs areas outside of PCF? Right now, I link to both docs on the *SSO* tile and docs on *IPsec*. I feel like discussing these components is a worthy exercise, because it helps users have a more comprehensive security education, but they aren't strictly in the PCF docs area (docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf). Is this okay?

1. Right now, 90% of the content in this guide is linked to, not directly ported into the guide itself. Is this a good best practice? I think going forward, we'll have more content that lives exclusively in this guide, but as a first draft we're linking to a lot of existing content.
